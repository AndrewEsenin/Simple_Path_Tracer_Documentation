## Description
Simple Path Tracer is a C++ Plugin containing a set of functions for editing and drawing paths both in the editor and in rantime. 
The plugin also includes ready blueprint examples that show how the plugin functions can be used.

To draw a path, you just need an array of points.

The Blueprint examples use an array of spline points to draw the path. 
Spline is convenient to use to customize the appearance of the path, but the spline itself is not necessary, the path can be built through any array of points, for example, obtained as Navmesh Path or with the help of some of your algorithm.

You can download the demo level (for UE versions 4.6 - 5.3)
link
The demo level provides many additional examples
Before you can open a demo level you need to enable the plugin for your engine version (read more).
You can migrate the entire level with examples or individual examples to your project using migrate (read more).

A description of all plugin functions can be found here
A description of the Blueprint examples can be viewed here

You can also check out my other Path Tracer Toolkit Asset (link)
This Asset is a more refined, optimized and extended version of it
Simple Path Tracer will suit you if you need a more optimized solution, for example if you need to draw many paths or with many points.

The Path Tracer Toolkit includes more content and visualization materials.

To summarize, Path Tracer Toolkit is more focused on visual style, while Simple Path Tracer is more focused on optimization and customization.
If necessary, you can use both toolkits together, e.g. to use the SPT to PTT path editing functions or to use PTT to SPT path markers.
